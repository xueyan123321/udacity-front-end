			<p>Dolphins are a widely distributed family of fully aquatic marine mammals. The oceanic dolphins comprise the family Delphinidae. Thirty extant species of oceanic dolphins are described. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.</p>
